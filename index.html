	<h1>Cutting Edge Cuisine Just Not Where You'd Expect</h1>

	<p>Food Reframed is a unique travel and food show based on the premise that cutting edge cuisine and food innovation can come from anywhere: from an inventive grandmother, inspired aunt or a visionary farmer, as much as from a trained professional chef. Experimentation, new techniques and even food revolutions can be found in the streets as well as in restaurants, in a village as much as in a city, and across every environment, culture and socio-economic class. <br>
	With the spontaneity of live field production and the perspicacity of well-researched journalism and an awareness of global food, history and culture, this show will discover food innovation in unexpected places, from radically new flavor combinations and uses of ingredients to revolutions in food production and sustainability. Exploring destinations well off the foodie traveler path, we’ll meet maverick food creators who are building on or breaking from tradition.  With a focus on the progressive/modern rather that on the traditional / exotic, this show promises to be the most insightful and relevant food and travel show on the planet. <br>
	Countless TV food shows have made household names out of creative chefs and restaurants in famous foodie capitals like New York, LA, London, Paris, Bologna and Melbourne. Yet when it comes to less mainstream destinations, we only get to see the traditional and the “weird” – never the modern and innovative. <br>
	This is the untold story of modern cuisine, where you don’t need Michelin stars for your talent to be recognized.</p>
